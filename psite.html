                    Alan Turing-- considered the father of computer science, is an English 
                    computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. </br>
                    Turing is best known for breaking the German ENIGMA ciphers during WWII at the GCCS war station at Bletchely Park, England, 
                    and creating the 'Turing Test'- which has become the most significant test for evaluating the intelligence of an AI.</br>
                    Despite his immense contribution to the field of computer science, and his brave efforts during WWII, Turing was convicted of homesexuality. 
                    Soon after, on 7th June, 1954, Turing was found dead with traces of cyanide poison in his system; his death was ruled a suicide.

                <h2 id="el">Early life<img src="plus.png" id="plus1" style="width:20px; height:20px;"></h2>
                <span id="toggle1">English scientist Alan Turing was born Alan Mathison Turing on June 23, 
                    1912, in Maida Vale, London, England. At a young age, he displayed signs of high intelligence, which 
                    some of his teachers recognized, but did not necessarily respect. When Turing attended the well-known independent 
                    Sherborne School at the age of 13, he became particularly interested in math and science.<br>

After Sherborne, Turing enrolled at King's College (University of Cambridge) in Cambridge, 
England, studying there from 1931 to 1934. As a result of his dissertation, in
 which he proved the central limit theorem, Turing was elected a fellow at the school upon his graduation.<br>

In 1936, Turing delivered a paper, "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the 
Entscheidungsproblem," in which he presented the notion of a universal machine (later called the 
“Universal Turing Machine," and then the "Turing machine") capable of computing anything that is computable: 
The central concept of the modern computer was based on Turing’s paper.<br>

Over the next two years, Turing studied mathematics and cryptology at the Institute for Advanced Study in 
Princeton, New Jersey. After receiving his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1938, he returned to Cambridge, 
and then took a part-time position with the Government Code and Cypher School, a British code-breaking organization.</span>

                <span id="toggle2"> During World War II, Turing was a leading participant in wartime code-b
                    reaking, particularly that of German ciphers. He worked at Bletchley Park, the GCCS wart
                    ime station, where he made five major advances in the field of cryptanalysis, including 
                    specifying the bombe, an electromechanical device used to help decipher German Enigma encrypted signals. 
                        Turing’s contributions to the code-breaking process didn’t stop there: He also wrote
                         two papers about mathematical approaches to code-breaking, which became such importa
                         nt assets to the Code and Cypher School (later known as the Government Communications 
                         Headquarters) that the GCHQ waited until April 2012 to release them to the National Ar
                         chives of the United Kingdom.<br>

Turing moved to London in the mid-1940s, and began working for the National Physical Laboratory. Amo
ng his most notable contributions while working at the facility, Turing led the design work for the Auto
matic Computing Engine and ultimately created a groundbreaking blueprint for store-program computers. 
Though a complete version of the ACE was never built, 
its concept has been used as a model by tech corporations worldwide for several years, influencing the 
design of the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G-15—credited by many in the tech industry
 as the world’s first personal computer—among other computer models.<br>

Turing went on to hold high-ranking positions in the mathematics department and later the computing l
aboratory at the University of Manchester in the late 1940s. He first addressed the issue of artificial 
intelligence in his 1950 paper, "Computing machinery and intelligence," and proposed an experiment known as the 
“Turing Test”—an effort to create an intelligence design standard for the tech industry. Over the past
 several decades, the test has significantly influenced debates over artificial intelligence.</span>
